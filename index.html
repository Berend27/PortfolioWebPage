            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>After being an iOS developer, I found that I was more intrigued by JavaScript development due to its many uses and my interest in creating websites.</p>
            <p>I enrolled Thinkful due to its powerful combination of mentorship and self-paced learning!</p>
            <p>What I like about web development:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>The versatility - I can make websites that look great in both mobile and desktop environments! Plus JavaScript can now be used for mobile apps and desktop software!</li>
              <li>The simple syntax of JavaScript</li>
              <li>Structuring pages with HTML</li>
              <li>Styling pages with CSS!</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In addition to programming, I'm interested in playing Tennis and learning Spanish!</p>
            <p>Please reach out if you're looking to hire a new developer or are in search of a good hackathon partner. I love being part of a great team!
